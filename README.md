A 3D Graphics Engine written in pure C that renders 3D models as ASCII art in your terminal.  
Built entirely from mathematical foundations without relying on OpenGL, DirectX, or any graphics libraries, it implements the complete rendering pipeline:  

* Perspective Projection
* Surface Rasterization
* Depth Buffering
* Lighting

Load any OBJ file and watch it come to life as dynamic ANSI graphics with real-time rotation and dynamic shading.  

Example output with icosphere.obj
